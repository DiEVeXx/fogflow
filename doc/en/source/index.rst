FogFlow is an IoT edge computing framework that automatically orchestrates dynamic data processing flows over cloud and edges 
based on various **context**, including:

- *system context*: the available system resources from all layers;
- *data context*: the registered metadata of all available data entities; 
- *usage context*: the expected QoS defined by users. 
    
By leveraging these contextual information, FogFlow is able to provide optimized QoS with minimal development effort and nearly zero operation overhead. 
Currently, FogFlow has been applied into various business use cases in the areas of retails, smart cities, and smart industry.
